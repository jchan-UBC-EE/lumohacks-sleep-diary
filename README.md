## Inspiration

https://drrandhawa.com/lumohacks/

After attending Dr. Randhawa's presentation on sleep disorders, we decided to create a sleep diary web application.

## What It Does
Dr. Randhawa mentioned that there is no online form, so we created an online form that patients can fill in. After recording the information, they will be able to print a summary and bring it to their appointment.

## How We Built It
With lots of Red Bull and lack of sleep, we created the web application.

## Challenges
Getting the backend of our project to work was challenging.

## Accomplishments 
We created a form that is connected to a database. 

## What We Learned
We learned how to create a form online.
