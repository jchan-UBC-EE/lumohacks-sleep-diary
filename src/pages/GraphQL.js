[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) is a *query language* for APIs. It enables declarative data fetching and thus ties in perfectly with React as a declarative framework for building user interfaces. GraphQL can either complement or entirely replace the usage of REST APIs. 

The main difference between REST and GraphQL is that RESTful APIs have *multiple endpoints* that return *fixed data structures* whereas a GraphQL server only exposes a *single endpoint* and returns *flexible data structures*. This works because a client that needs data from the server also submits its precise data requirements in each request which allows the server to tailor the response exactly according to the client’s needs. 

You can learn more about the differences between GraphQL and REST [here](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest/). To get a high-level overview and understand more about the architectural use cases of GraphQL, take a look at [this](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/3-big-picture/) article.

 ## Minimal Example

 Here is a minimal example that demonstrates how to load data using [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/) and [Apollo Client](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/). If you want to understand more about how it works, check out the following chapters.

 ${
 <WebPlayer
 code={simpleInstagramApp}
 vendorComponents={vendorComponents}
 />
 }
 */

export default props =>
  <Page {...props}>
    <PageHeader
      title={props.title}
      author={"@nikolasburk"}
      authorURL={'https://twitter.com/nikolasburk'}
    />
    {content}
